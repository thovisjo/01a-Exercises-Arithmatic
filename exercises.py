# A more robust (and modern) way to put things into strings is using the format method
"{0} can be {1}".format("strings", "formatted")

# You can use names instead of numbers to make it easier to keep things straight
"{name} wants to eat {food}".format(name="Bob", food="lasagna")

# For your next assignment, you will need to use random numbers
